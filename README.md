# myPhone
Learnable task 8

Lets start with the basics, this is a console application json file linked as a database for my contact list.

## Phone Class
My main class with multiple methods included. I build my code by asking what I'd expect to see on the real thing so I included the following:
- A dialing function for unsaved phone numbers.
- A contacts class with its own methods for saved contacts
-- Add, Edit, Delete and dial.
- An observer object with two observer classes, observer1 and observer2
